## Usage

### Command Line

After installation, you can use PullPal from the command line:

```bash
# Make sure you have a .env file with your GitHub token
# GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here

# Fetch a single PR
pullpal --pr 123

# Fetch multiple PRs
pullpal --prs 123,124,125

# Fetch the 10 most recently updated PRs
pullpal --latest 10

# Specify a custom output directory
pullpal --pr 123 --output-dir my_pr_data

# Save in JSON format instead of Markdown
pullpal --pr 123 --format json

# Override the token from .env file
pullpal --pr 123 --token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN

# Specify a different repository
pullpal --owner username --repo repository --pr 123
```

### Python API

You can also use PullPal as a library in your Python code:

```python
from pullpal.PullPal import fetch_conversation, save_conversation

# Fetch a PR conversation
conversation = fetch_conversation("octocat", "hello-world", 123, "your_github_token")

# Save the conversation as Markdown
save_conversation(conversation, "pr-123.md", "md")

# Or save as JSON
save_conversation(conversation, "pr-123.json", "json")
```

## Output Format

By default, the script saves conversations in Markdown format with the following structure:

```markdown
