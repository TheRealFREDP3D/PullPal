# Plan for publishing PullPal on PyPI

1.  **Ensure the project has a valid PyPI name:** The name "pullpal" is used in `setup.py`. It's important to check if this name is available on PyPI. If not, a different name will need to be chosen.
2.  **Update `setup.py` with correct information:** Verify that the `setup.py` file contains accurate information, including the project name, version, author, email, description, and dependencies. The version should follow semantic versioning.
3.  **Create a PyPI account (if needed):** If you don't already have a PyPI account, you will need to create one at [https://pypi.org/account/register/](https://pypi.org/account/register/).
4.  **Install `twine`:** Twine is a tool for securely uploading packages to PyPI. It can be installed using pip: `pip install twine`
5.  **Build the distribution package:** Use the `python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel` command to build the source distribution and wheel package.
6.  **Upload the package to PyPI:** Use the `twine upload dist/*` command to upload the package to PyPI. This will prompt for your PyPI username and password.
7.  **Verify the package on PyPI:** After uploading, verify that the package is available on PyPI at [https://pypi.org/project/pullpal/](https://pypi.org/project/pullpal/) (or the chosen name).
